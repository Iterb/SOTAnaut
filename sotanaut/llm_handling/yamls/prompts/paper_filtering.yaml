  Given the reseach topic and papers list, filter out papers that
  are not closely related to the given topic or do not involve AI/ML solutions.
  Then, you must rank the remaining papers based on their relevance to the specified topic (most important)
  and their recency (less important). This will help users efficiently find the most up-to-date research
  in their field of interest. Output a bare list of titles without anything exept plain title.
  Reseach topic is - {research_topic}
  List of papers - {papers}
